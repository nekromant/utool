Necromant's utool
------------------------------
This is a small android app that allows you to run a custom script, once a device 
with a special markerfile in its root dir is mounted by the system. 
That's it. 
Create the script file with whatever you want to, create an .IOMARKER file in the root 
of the flash jump drive, or microsd (or change the filename in settings), fill in the path
to the script, pick if you want to run as root. 
Done.
It also broadcasts 3 actions: 

org.ncrmnt.utool.actions.FLASH_DETECTED - once a tagged media is detected for the first time
org.ncrmnt.utool.actions.USCRIPT_DONE - once a script is done working
org.ncrmnt.utool.actions.FLASH_REMOVED - once the tagged flash is removed from the system

So you can pick those up in your own apps

Only one marker tagged flash at the same time is supported.
It is a quick hack for my 'internal use' in the terminal made out of a flytouch 2 tablet,
so it's somewhat feature limited. If you want to extend it or have a questing - drop me a 
mail
